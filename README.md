## Ghosler - Ghost Newsletters ðŸ‘»

**Ghosler** enables easy sending of newsletter using your own email and SMTP credentials when you are just starting
out & have a small to moderate user-base.

It is helpful for bypassing the limitations of the hardcoded Mailgun setup and supports tracking email deliverability
and opens, with the capability to use **multiple** email accounts.

##### Note:

1. Currently, only one newsletter is supported. **If you have multiple active newsletters, do not use this for now.**
2. The UI isn't too friendly on desktop as I do not have enough exp. in web, but gets the job done, if you are someone
   who can improve the UI, please contribute.

### Key Features

- **Support for Multiple Email Accounts**: Distribute newsletters through various email accounts, dividing member counts
  accordingly.
- **Tracking Email Performance**: Monitor email deliverability and open rates.
- **Customize Newsletter**: You can customize the newsletter via Settings, or go full on by editing the `*.ejs` files.

### Testing Configurations

Ghosler will always use a debug version of the configs i.e. `config.debug.json` if one exists. The JSON schema is the
same as in the [config.production.json](./config.production.json) file.

### TODOs

1. Add support for multiple newsletters.
2. Add feedback support in newsletter template.
3. Build a `CLI` to install, update & other options to manage Ghosler instance **[WIP]**.
